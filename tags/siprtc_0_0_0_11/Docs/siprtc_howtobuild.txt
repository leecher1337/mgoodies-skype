   Copyright (c) 2007 Paul Shmakov


REQUIRED ENVIRONMENT

   To build SIP RTC plugin you need the following:

     - Visual C++ 2003 or 2005.
     - WTL 8.0 or later (http://wtl.sourceforge.net) must be
       installed and added to include paths of VC.
     - (optional) Platform SDK for 2000 or XP or Vista.
     - (optional) RTC SDK 1.3.
       This component is optional because rtccore.h,
       rtccore_i.c, and rtcerr.h files from this SDK are
       already included in this distribution package.
       Anyway, it's highly recommended to install it
       to get the documentation.
     - Source code of Miranda IM 0.7 or later.


HOW TO BUILD

     Just extract all the files into Miranda\protocols\SipRtc
     directory, open siprtc_7.sln (for VC 2003) or siprtc_8.sln
     (for VC 2005), build it.

     That's all.
