Contact Left Channel History plugin
-----------------------------------

CAUTION: THIS IS AN ALPHA STAGE PLUGIN. IT CAN DO VERY BAD THINGS. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

This is a very simple plugin that add an entry to the history when a contact session was closed and your message window with that contact is still open. For some clients this means that the contact closed his message window.

The logged entry has the type EVENTTYPE_CONTACTLEFTCHANNEL (9004), and, by now, only tabSRMM and History++ are able to display it in the message log.

It requires a modified MSN version to work. It can be found here:

Note that this version is my personal mod, and is totally unsuported. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
