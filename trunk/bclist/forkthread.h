/*

Purpose:
	
	A safe version of _beginthread()

Description:

	A new thread is created and the source thread is paused until
	internal code to call MS_SYSTEM_THREAD_PUSH is made in the context
	if the new thread.

	The source thread is then released and then the user supplied
	code is called, when that function returns -- MS_SYSTEM_THREAD_POP
	is called and then the thread returns.

	This insures that Miranda will not exit whilst new threads
	are trying to be born; and the unwind wait stack will unsure
	that Miranda will wait for all created threads to return as well.

Cavets:

	The function must be reimplemented across MT plugins, since thread
	creation depends on CRT which can not be shared.
