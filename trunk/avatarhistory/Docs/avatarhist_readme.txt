Avatar History plugin
-----------------------------------

CAUTION: THIS IS AN BETA STAGE PLUGIN. IT CAN DO VERY BAD THINGS. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

This plugins keep a history of contact avatars. It stores the files on the disk and uses miranda history to keep track of then.

This plugin is really made by MattJ, I'm only doing some changes to allow better handling of the avatars.

If you want to import the old history to new format, you can use the Avatar History Importer plugin by TioDuke. It will import old avatars to new format, allowing to keep only one copy of each avatar (but new avatars may appear duplicated, because the hash function used by the importer may not be the same as the one used by the protocol). It can be downloaded at:

To user the importer, you should:
1. Install the new version of Avatar History
2. Start miranda with all protocols offline
3. Setup Avatar History options (some are better if set once and not changed anymore). You will need 'Show expert options' checkbox enabled
4. Finish miranda and install Avatar History Importer
5. Start miranda with all protocols offline
6. A messagebox will appear, telling that the importer will run. Wait until the importer ended messagebox.
7. Enjoy ;)
