                                PopUp plugin
Plugin Name: PopUp
Plugin authors: Luca Santarelli aka hrk (hrk@users.sourceforge.net)
                Victor Pavlychko aka zazoo (nullbie@gmail.com)
===============================================================================
The purpose of this plugin is to give developers a common "platform/interface"
to show PopUps. It is born from the source code of NewStatusNotify, another
plugin I've made.

Remember that users *must* have this plugin enabled, or they won't get any
popup. Write this in the requirements, do whatever you wish ;-)... but tell
them!

/*
When you call MS_POPUP_ADDPOPUP, my plugin will check if the given POPUPDATA structure is filled with acceptable values. If not, the data will be rejected and no popup will be shown.

- lpzText should be given, because it's really bad if a user chooses to have the second line displayed
and it's empty :-) Just write it and let the user choose if it will be displayed or not.

- PluginWindowProc is a WNDPROC address you have to give me. Why? What? Where? Calm down 8)
My plugin will take care of the creation of the popup, of the destruction of the popup, of the come into
view and the hiding of the popup. Transparency, animations... all this stuff.
My plugin will not (as example) open the MessageWindow when you left click on a popup.
Why? Because I don't know if your popup desires to open the MessageWindow :))))
This means that you need to make a WNDPROC which takes care of the WM_messages you need.
For example, WM_COMMAND or WM_CONTEXTMENU or WM_LMOUSEUP or whatever.
At the end of your WNDPROC remember to "return DefWindowProc(hwnd, msg, wParam, lParam);"
When you process a message that needs a return value (an example could be WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC,
but you don't need to catch it 'cause it's my plugin's job), simply return the nedeed value. :)
The default WNDPROC does nothing.

- PluginData is a pointer to a void, which means a pointer to anything. You can make your own structure
to store the data you need (example: a status information, a date, your name, whatever) and give me a
pointer to that struct.
You will need to destroy that structure and free the memory when the PopUp is going to be destroyed. You'll know this when you receive a UM_FREEPLUGINDATA. The name tells it all: free your own plugin data.

Appendix A: Messages my plugin will handle and your WNDPROC will never see.
WM_CREATE, WM_DESTROY, WM_TIMER, WM_ERASEBKGND
WM_CTLCOLOR* [whatever it may be: WM_CTLCOLORDLG, WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC...]
WM_PAINT, WM_PRINT, WM_PRINTCLIENT

Appendix B: "What do I need to do?!?".
Here is an example in C.

//Your plugin is in /plugins/myPlugin/ or in miranda32/something/
#include "../../plugins/PopUp/m_popup.h"

Define your own plugin data if you need it. In this example, we need it and we'll use NewStatusNotify as example: thsi plugin shows a popup when someone in your contact list changes his/hers status. We'll need to know his status, both current and old one.
typedef struct {
	WORD oldStatus;
	WORD newStatus;
} MY_PLUGIN_DATA;

When we need to show the popup, we do:
{
	POPUPDATA ppd;
	hContact = A_VALID_HANDLE_YOU_GOT_FROM_SOMEWHERE;
	hIcon = A_VALID_HANDLE_YOU_GOT_SOMEWHERE;
	char * lpzContactName = (char*)CallService(MS_CLIST_GETCONTACTDISPLAYNAME,(WPARAM)lhContact,0);
	//99% of the times you'll just copy this line.
	//1% of the times you may wish to change the contact's name. I don't know why you should, but you can.
	char * lpzText;
	//The text for the second line. You could even make something like: char lpzText[128]; lstrcpy(lpzText, "Hello world!"); It's your choice.
	COLORREF colorBack = GetSysColor(COLOR_BTNFACE); //The colour of Miranda's option Pages (and many other windows...)
	COLORREF colorText = RGB(255,255,255); //White.
	MY_PLUGIN_DATA * mpd = (MY_PLUGIN_DATA*)malloc(sizeof(MY_PLUGIN_DATA));

	ZeroMemory(ppd, sizeof(ppd)); //This is always a good thing to do.
	ppd.lchContact = (HANDLE)hContact; //Be sure to use a GOOD handle, since this will not be checked.
	ppd.lchIcon = hIcon;
	lstrcpy(ppd.lpzContactName, lpzContactName);
	lstrcpy(ppd.lpzText, lpzText);
	ppd.colorBack = colorBack;
	ppd.colorText = colorText;
	ppd.PluginWindowProc = (WNDPROC)PopupDlgProc;

	//Now the "additional" data.
	mpd->oldStatus = ID_STATUS_OFFLINE;
	mpd->newStatus = ID_STATUS_ONLINE;

	//Now that the plugin data has been filled, we add it to the PopUpData.
	ppd.PluginData = mpd;

	//Now that every field has been filled, we want to see the popup.
	CallService(MS_POPUP_ADDPOPUP, (WPARAM)&ppd, 0);
}

static int CALLBACK PopupDlgProc(HWND hWnd, UINT message, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
{
	switch(message) {
		case WM_COMMAND:
			if ((HIWORD)wParam == STN_CLICKED) { //It was a click on the Popup.
				PUDeletePopUp(hWnd);
				return TRUE;
			}
			break;
		case UM_FREEPLUGINDATA: {

			mpd = (MY_PLUGIN_DATA*)CallService(MS_POPUP_GETPLUGINDATA, (WPARAM)hWnd,(LPARAM)mpd);
			if (mdp > 0) free(mpd);
			return TRUE; //TRUE or FALSE is the same, it gets ignored.
