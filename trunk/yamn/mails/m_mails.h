//================================== YAMN MAIL SERVICES ==================================
//

//CreateAccountMail Service
//Your plugin should call this to create new mail for your plugin.

//returns pointer to (HYAMNMAIL) or pointer to your structure returned from imported NewMailFcnPtr, if implemented

//DeleteAccountMail Service
//Deletes plugin's mail from memory. You probably won't use this service, because it deletes only account
//without any synchronization. Use MS_YAMN_DELETEACCOUNT instead. Note that deleting mail is something like "this mail is
//not more in the account".
//WPARAM- (HYAMNPROTOPLUGIN) handle of plugin, which is going to delete mail
//LPARAM- (HYAMNMAIL) mail going to delete
//returns zero if failed, otherwise returns nonzero
#define	MS_YAMN_DELETEACCOUNTMAIL	"YAMN/Service/DeletePluginMail"
#define DeleteAccountMail(x,y)	CallService(MS_YAMN_DELETEACCOUNTMAIL,(WPARAM)x,(LPARAM)y)

//LoadMailData Service
//This service loads mail from standard YAMN storage (now it is 1 file, from which mails are loaded once at startup, but
//in the future it can be Miranda profile file or separate file (1 file per 1 mail). It depends on YAMN implementation...
//Use this function if you want to read or write to MailData member of mail structure. Please use synchronization obejcts
//before calling this service (so you must have read or write access to mails)
//WPARAM- (HYAMNMAIL) mail where to load data
//LPARAM- (DWORD) version of MAILDATA structure (use YAMN_MAILDATAVERSION definition)
//returns pointer to new allocated MailData structure (the same value as MailData member)

#define LoadMailData(x)		(PMAILDATA)CallService(MS_YAMN_LOADMAILDATA,(WPARAM)x,(LPARAM)YAMN_MAILDATAVERSION)

//UnloadMailData Service
//This service frees mail data from memory. It does not care if data were saved or not. So you should save mail before you
//release data from memory.
//WPARAM- (HYAMNMAIL) mail whose data are about to free
//LPARAM- nothing yet
//returns nonzero if success
#define MS_YAMN_UNLOADMAILDATA		"YAMN/Service/UnloadMailData"
#define UnloadMailData(x)	CallService(MS_YAMN_UNLOADMAILDATA,(WPARAM)x,(LPARAM)0)

//SaveMailData Service
//This service saves mail to standard YAMN storage (when using now 1 book file, it does nothing, because save is done when
//using MS_YAMN_WRITEACCOUNT service. In the future, mail can be saved to Miranda profile or to separate file...)
//WPARAM- (HYAMNMAIL) mail to save
//LPARAM- (DWORD) version of MAILDATA structure (use YAMN_MAILDATAVERSION definition)

//================================== QUICK FUNCTION CALL DEFINITIONS ========================================
//

//These are defininitions for YAMN exported functions. Your plugin can use them.
//pYAMNFcn is global variable, it is pointer to your structure containing YAMN functions.
//It is something similar like pluginLink variable in Miranda plugin. If you use
//this name of variable, you have already defined these functions and you can use them.
//It's similar to Miranda's CreateService function.

//How to use YAMN functions:
//Create a structure containing pointer to functions you want to use in your plugin
//This structure can look something like this:
//
//	struct
//	{
//		YAMN_SYNCHROMIMEMSGSFCN	SynchroMessagesFcn;
//		YAMN_APPENDQUEUEFCN	AppendQueueFcn;
//	} *pYAMNMailFcn;
//
//then you have to fill this structure with pointers...
//you have to use YAMN service to get pointer, like this (I wrote here all functions you may need,
//you can copy to your sources only those you need):
//
//	pYAMNMailFcn->SynchroMessagesFcn=(YAMN_SYNCHROMIMEMSGSFCN)CallService(MS_YAMN_GETFCNPTR,(WPARAM)YAMN_SYNCHROMIMEMSGSID,(LPARAM)0);
//	pYAMNMailFcn->TranslateHeaderFcn=(YAMN_TRANSLATEHEADERFCN)CallService(MS_YAMN_GETFCNPTR,(WPARAM)YAMN_TRANSLATEHEADERID,(LPARAM)0);
//	pYAMNMailFcn->AppendQueueFcn=(YAMN_APPENDQUEUEFCN)CallService(MS_YAMN_GETFCNPTR,(WPARAM)YAMN_APPENDQUEUEID,(LPARAM)0);
//	pYAMNMailFcn->DeleteMessagesToEndFcn=(YAMN_DELETEMIMEQUEUEFCN)CallService(MS_YAMN_GETFCNPTR,(WPARAM)YAMN_DELETEMIMEQUEUEID,(LPARAM)0);
//	pYAMNMailFcn->DeleteMessageFromQueueFcn=(YAMN_DELETEMIMEMESSAGEFCN)CallService(MS_YAMN_GETFCNPTR,(WPARAM)YAMN_DELETEMIMEMESSAGEID,(LPARAM)0);
//	pYAMNMailFcn->FindMessageByIDFcn=(YAMN_FINDMIMEMESSAGEFCN)CallService(MS_YAMN_GETFCNPTR,(WPARAM)YAMN_FINDMIMEMESSAGEID,(LPARAM)0);
//	pYAMNMailFcn->CreateNewDeleteQueueFcn=(YAMN_CREATENEWDELETEQUEUEFCN)CallService(MS_YAMN_GETFCNPTR,(WPARAM)YAMN_CREATENEWDELETEQUEUEID,(LPARAM)0);
//	pYAMNMailFcn->SetRemoveQueueFlagsFcn=(YAMN_SETREMOVEQUEUEFLAGSFCN)CallService(MS_YAMN_GETFCNPTR,(WPARAM)YAMN_SETREMOVEQUEUEFLAGSID,(LPARAM)0);
//
//
//and in your plugin just simply use e.g.:
//
//	DeleteMIMEQueue(MyAccount,OldMessages);		//this command deletes all messages in the mail queue OldMessages
