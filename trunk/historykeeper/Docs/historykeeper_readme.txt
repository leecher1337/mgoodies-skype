History Keeper plugin
---------------------

This plugin logs some events to the history and show popups. 

The events that are handled are:
 - Nickname changes
 - Client changes
 - Idle changes
 - Status changes
 - Status Message changes
 - X-Status changes
 - X-Status Message changes
 - Listening changes

For it to work, it depends on some popup plugin (YAPP or Popup+) and on History Events plugin. It also support Variables plugin.

This plugin requires at least Miranda 0.7

The event icons were created by Angeli-Ka (Thanks!).

Also, Faith Healer created another nice set of icons (Thanks!): http://www.pescuma.org/miranda/historykeeper_fh_icons.zip

To do:
 - Integrate avh with it?
 - Support remembering status message per status
 - On status change, allow customizing popups per status change
