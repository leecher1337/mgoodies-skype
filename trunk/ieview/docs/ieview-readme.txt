IEView user's manual & FAQ v1.0
-------------------------------

1. Overview
-----------

IEView is a replacement for RichEdit-based log window available in SRMM
or TabSRMM. It cannot be used as a standalone plugin. It provides new features
not achievable with RichEdit like:
- animated emoticons,
- background images,
- customization of log appearance with CSS files,
- look of log window may be built from scratch with HTML templates

IEView works in 3 modes:

A) compatibility mode (either SRMM or TabSRMM)
It tries to mimic original look of SRMM or TabSRMM, but in addition
animated emoticons and wallpapers are available. Text formatting and
other options are taken directly from SRMM or TabSRMM settings.
Some of TabSRMM features are not supported, for example text indentation.
Both HTML and CSS styles are automatically generated by IEView.

B) compatibility mode with external CSS

IEView follows SRMM or TabSRMM log formatting settings, but you can change more than
just colours, because an external, manually adjusted CSS file is used along with computer
generated HTML code. More information on CSS classes used by IEView are available in included
CSS examples.

C) template-based mode

IEView does not generate either CSS or HTML, but it uses HTML templates provided
by the user instead. You can use several variable in templates including message text, date,
nicknames etc. This part of IEView is still changing, so more information on templates is
included in a separate file called templates_info.txt.


2. Installation
---------------

To install IEView please copy ieview.dll and ieview folder into your
Miranda's plugins directory. Ohter folders included in the pack are as
follows:
emots      - a very simple set of animated emoticons
css        - examples of CSS files for tabsrmm and srmm
templates  - examples of HTML templates, which can be used with IEView

emots, css and templates folders may be copied anywhere.

In order to use IEView with SRMM you need a modified version of SRMM available here:

If IEVIew is among avtive plugins it will be automatically used for message log rendering,
otherwise regular RichEdit control is used.

In order to use IEView with TabSRMM you need at least TabSRMM 0.9.9.5. Moreover it is necessary
to turn on support for IEView in TabSRMM configuration.
Please go to Window Sessions -> Message Window -> Message log options page, locate and
check "Activate support for external".

3. Configuration
----------------

Wallpaper - select any image format supported by Internet Explorer (JPG, GIF etc.)
Emoticons - just select .asl file(s). They can be located anywhere in any folder.

4. FAQ
------
Q: Is there any stable version of IEView?
A: No, IEView is still in a VERY EARLY stage of development (so-called alpha version)

Q: Is SmileyAdd required in order to use animated emoticons ?
A: SmileyAdd is NOT required to see animated emoticons in the log, however,
   IEView does not provide any button for smiley selection, so no SmileyAdd means no such button.

Q: Does IEView support Unicode ?
A: No, not yet.

Q: What version of Miranda is required to run IEView ?
A: IEView DOES require Miranda IM 04. RC2.
   It may work with older releases, but there is no guarantee !

Q: I use TabSRMM, why IEView does not work ?
A: Make sure Window Sessions -> Message Window -> Message log -> Activate support of external log
   is turned on.

5. Change Log
-------------
1.0.1.10:
+ Unicode support (I would like to thank Nightwish for his support)
+ RTL support (template and CSS mode)
+ new variables: %avatarIn%, %avatarOut%, %nameIn%, %nameOut%, %proto% (please see ieview-templates.txt for details)
+ auto-scrolling to left
* bugfixes: memory leaks, focus stealing, message grouping (Nightwish, thanks again) and a lot of other bugfixes
1.0.1.7:
+ animated smileys selection window
  This feature is not fully available yet, because it requires also changes in TabSRMM source code and
  you can use it in rather experimental mode at the moment. In order to do that you have to remove
  SmileyAdd plugin and check "Replace SmileyAdd" on IEVIew->Emoticons options page.
  Hopefully Nightwish will add support for new IEView smiley selection to TabSRMM soon.
  Moreover, there is a new setting value available in .asl files. It is called SelectionSize and all
  authors of .asl files are encouraged to use it in order to finetune the appearance of smileys selection
  window. Please find more details in emots.asl file included in this package.
* bugfixes in order to remove crashes and memory leaks in IEView (Nightwish, THX :)
* better handling of http:// paths to CSS and background image
* backslashes in URLs are converted to (javascript-friendly) slashes
+ 2 new variables: %avatar% and %cid%
  %avatar% - link to an avatar file  (JPG, GIF etc.), if the file does not exist %avatar% will contain
  value of %base%/noavatar.jpg.
  %cid% - contact id, not available in HTMLStart template yet
