Meebo - Jabber plugin
---------------------

CAUTION: THIS IS AN BETA STAGE PLUGIN. IT CAN DO VERY BAD THINGS. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

This is a plugin for the jabber protocol, to make it work better with the meebo service (mainly with the meebo me widget).

It has the following changes regarding the official jabber protocol:
- Option to Automatically authorize all new contacts
- Option to Always remove meebo me contacts when they go offline (with or without history)
- Detection of meebo me MirVer
- Better handling of groups and nicks sent by meebo me 

The zip contains also some nice icons made by Angeli-Ka (thanks!).

To make this work you need this mod of jabber that support plugins:
Ansi: http://pescuma.mirandaim.ru/miranda/jabber_mp.zip
Unicode: http://pescuma.mirandaim.ru/miranda/jabber_mpW.zip
With some lucky it will be incorporated in the SVN soon.

It also need the latest version of miranda (at SVN) to correctly handle the option pages.
