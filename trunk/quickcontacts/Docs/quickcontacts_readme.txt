Quick Contacts plugin
---------------------

On pressing an user defined hotkey an dialog pops up where you can
enter a contacts name or select it from a combobox and send it
messages/files/urls an look at his details.

This is a mod of the Hotkey plugin by micron-x

To be able to set the hotkey, you need clist_modern (or some other that implements Hotkeys2).
