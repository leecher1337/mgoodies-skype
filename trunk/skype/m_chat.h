/*
	This plugin provides event driven chat rooms for protocols that wish to use it.
	It is built for IRC, which I also develop and is naturally biased towards IRC,
	but it should work very well with other protocols too. I will try to explain as
	careful as possible in this document how to use chat.dll

	-- General guidelines --

	There is one rule a protocol MUST follow to use this:

	1. Do not touch contacts that has a byte "ChatRoom" set to ANYTHING other than 0! (Could be 1, 2, 3, ...)
	This is because chat.dll adds contacts to the clist using the protocol name 
	supplied by the protocol. But this will naturally not work well if the 
	protocol also tampers with the contacts. The value of the BYTE indicates which type of
	window/contact it is (see the GCW_* flags below). There is two exceptions to this rule:
		
		* You should continue to handle the right click menu items of these 
		contacts as usual, by hooking the menu prebuild hook etc. Chat.dll can not 
		handle this in an efficient manner!
		
		* You should also handle when the user deletes the contact/room from the 
		contact list, as the protocol will then most likely have to send some message
		to the server that the user has left the room.

	2. The chat.dll plugin keeps its own copies of strings passed. 
	
*/

  
//	Example of implementing point 1: 

//	This is a code snippet that is common in protocols:

  

	hContact = (HANDLE) CallService(MS_DB_CONTACT_FINDFIRST, 0, 0);
	while (hContact) 
	{
		szProto = (char *) CallService(MS_PROTO_GETCONTACTBASEPROTO, (WPARAM) hContact, 0);
		if (szProto != NULL && !lstrcmpi(szProto, PROTONAME)) 
		{
//			... do something with the hContact here;
		}
		hContact = (HANDLE) CallService(MS_DB_CONTACT_FINDNEXT, (WPARAM) hContact, 0);
	}


  
//	You should do this instead:


  
	hContact = (HANDLE) CallService(MS_DB_CONTACT_FINDFIRST, 0, 0);
	while (hContact) 
	{
		szProto = (char *) CallService(MS_PROTO_GETCONTACTBASEPROTO, (WPARAM) hContact, 0);
		if (szProto != NULL && !lstrcmpi(szProto, PROTONAME)) 
		{
			if(DBGetContactSettingByte(hContact, PROTONAME, "ChatRoom", 0) == 0)
			{
//				... do something with the hContact here;
			}
		}
		hContact = (HANDLE) CallService(MS_DB_CONTACT_FINDNEXT, (WPARAM) hContact, 0);
	}


//	There is not more to it than that. To recapitulate: do not touch contacts where the
//	BYTE "ChatRoom" is set to 1, apart from the two exceptions mentioned!

//	... now onto how to use this thing!


#endif

/*	
	-- Register with the chat module --

	The first thing that a protocol need to do is register with chat.dll. This is best done
	after ALL modules has loaded naturally. The registration is needed to make sure that 
	the protocol obey rule 1 mentioned above, but equally important to set protocol specific
	settings.

/*
	-- Show an event --

	Events is what drives chat.dll! After having created the chat room with 
	MS_GC_NEWCHAT it is time to make it work for real. Start off by telling chat.dll
	what statuses a user can have by sending GC_EVENT_ADDGROUP as many times as needed. 
	Then send join events 
	(GC_EVENT_JOIN) to populate the user list. You will need to send one event 
	per user that should be added. When you are done with filling the user list 
	it is a good time to end the 'set up' phase and make the window visible by 
	calling a GC_EVENT_VISIBILITY event. A nice tip is to make sure the bAddToLog 
	member of GCEVENT is set to FALSE during the initial filling of the user list.

	The GCDEST structure and its members are always used, but what members of 
	GCEVENT to use is determined by what event is sent to chat.dll. bAddToLog and
	time is valid (at least where it makes sense). See the description of each event 
	for more information of what members that are valid.

	It is possible to send formatted text (bold, italics, underlined, foreground color 
	and background color) by using the following keywords in pszText:
	%cRRRGGGBBB	- set the foreground color
	%C			- set foreground color to default
	%fRRRGGGBBB	- set the background color
	%F			- set the background color to default
	%b			- enable bold
	%B			- disable bold
	%u			- enable underlined
	%U			- disable underlined
	%i			- enable italics
	%I			- disable italics
	%r			- reset all to default
	%%			- escape the formatting. Translates to %
