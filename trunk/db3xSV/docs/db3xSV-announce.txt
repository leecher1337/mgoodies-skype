Following up some requests and discussions in another thread 
(http://forums.miranda-im.org/showthread.php?t=2114) I am presenting alpha 
versions of "Virtualizable" mod of dbx_3x and SecureDB.

The mod permits the DB be "virtualized" - the whole db is copied to the memory 
and is accessed only there without performing any disk access. Later, on user 
request, or automatically the DB can be updated to the real DB file and 
bounded again to it.

One of the benefits of such approach is avoiding writing history. The user can 
configure Miranda and to virtualize the DB. The history will be written only to 
the image in the memory and on exit can be discarded.

When the db is virtualized the memory image can be written to new file - i.e. to 
create a backup.
It is possible to load the DB even from read-only media.

This mod is in very alpha stage and should be used with high precautions. Make 
backup of your DB before installing some of these plugins!

The mod is applied to dbx_3x 0.5.1.0 and to the updated 
(http://forums.miranda-im.org/showthread.php?p=28752#post28752) SecureDB 
(http://forums.miranda-im.org/showthread.php?t=2113).
It also includes Pescuma's PATH patch 
(http://saaplugin.no-ip.info/db3xV/path.patch) shortly described here 
(http://forums.miranda-im.org/showpost.php?p=34468&postcount=13) and there 
(http://forums.miranda-im.org/showpost.php?p=25123&postcount=28).

The behavior can be controlled by mirandaboot.ini. You may want to see a sample
