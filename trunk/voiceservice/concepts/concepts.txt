General ideas about the plugin:

- A voice provider can call contacts from varios protocols (even if it is a protocol)

- A voice contact can call a contact with diferent means (by the contact and by number associated with the contact)

- A voice provider is a protocol if it has the same name as an account

- Each can can have one contact associated with it (or none)

- More than one call can happen at the same time

- It is voice service's responsability to handle the call switching/answering/droping logic

- Voice provides should be as simple as possible (they are already complicated by the protocols itself)

- As long as possible voice service should show the options to the user and the providers should only read it from the DB

- All the GUI (as far as possible) is voice service's responsability



Future:

- Voice service will (with some luck) handle video in the future

- The dialpad will be skinnable



- Some hookable way to fetch numbers from contacts

- Number formaters

- Record calls?
