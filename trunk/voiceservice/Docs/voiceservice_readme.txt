Voice Service plugin
--------------------

CAUTION: THIS IS AN ALPHA STAGE PLUGIN. IT CAN DO VERY BAD THINGS. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

This is a service to provide a common user interface for voice calls to protocols/plugins that support it.

For it to work, protocols/plugins need to support it. By now, only a mod of MirandaComm2 does that (to check it out, look at its thread in miranda forum).

Many thanks to Angeli-Ka for creating the icons.
